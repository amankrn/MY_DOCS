   workers = 4  # Adjust based on available CPU cores.
   ```

2. **Memory Limits**: These settings help prevent memory overuse by recycling workers that exceed defined memory limits.

   - Soft Limit: 
     ```ini
     limit_memory_soft = 640000000  # Recycle worker after exceeding this.
     ```
   - Hard Limit:
     ```ini
     limit_memory_hard = 760000000  # Kill worker if it exceeds this.
     ```

3. **Time Limits**: Configure how long requests can run before being killed.

   ```ini
   limit_time_cpu = 60  # Max CPU time per request (in seconds).
   limit_time_real = 120  # Max real time per request.
   ```

   ```ini
   log_level = info
   ```

2. **Max Cron Threads**: Define the number of threads for scheduled jobs (cron jobs).
   ```ini
   max_cron_threads = 2
   ```

3. **SMTP Server Setup**: Set up your SMTP server for sending emails.
   ```ini
   smtp_server = smtp.gmail.com
   smtp_port = 587
   smtp_user = your_email@gmail.com
   smtp_password = your_password
   ```

4. **Disable Demo Data**: Prevent demo data from being loaded into the database.
   ```ini
   without_demo = all
   ```

#### **Sample Configuration File with Advanced Parameters**:

```ini
[options]
admin_passwd = admin
db_host = localhost

## Advanced Technical Concepts for Odoo Configuration

For more complex Odoo deployments or highly customized environments, the following advanced technical settings will help enhance security, performance, scalability, and maintainability.


These advanced configurations are meant for larger deployments or users with more complex requirements. By implementing these features, you can enhance the security, performance, and scalability of your Odoo instance, ensuring it can handle increased loads and provide a better user experience.


### 1. **Advanced Security Settings**

#### **Session Timeout**:
For added security, set a session timeout to automatically log out users after a period of inactivity:

```ini
session_gc = 3600  # Sets session timeout to 1 hour.
```

#### **Password Policies**:
Enforce password strength and expiration using Odoo's password policy module:

- **Password Expiry**: Require users to update their passwords periodically.
- **Password Strength**: Set a minimum password length and complexity.

#### **Enforcing HTTPS with HSTS**:
Enable proxy mode in Odoo and configure HSTS in your reverse proxy for secure HTTPS communication:

```ini
proxy_mode = True
```

In your reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx), configure HSTS:

```nginx
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```

---

### 2. **Advanced Database Management**

#### **Database Caching**:
To improve performance, enable database query caching or integrate Redis for session and cache storage:

```ini
cache_db = redis://localhost:6379/0  # Configure Redis for caching.
```

#### **Connection Pooling**:
For high database loads, use a connection pooler like **pgbouncer** to manage database connections:

```ini
db_host = 127.0.0.1
db_port = 6432  # Use pgbouncer's port.
```

---

### 3. **Load Balancing and High Availability**

#### **Multiple Odoo Instances**:
Set up load balancing (e.g., using Nginx or HAProxy) to distribute traffic across multiple Odoo instances:

```nginx
upstream odoo_servers {
    server odoo1.example.com;
    server odoo2.example.com;
}
server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://odoo_servers;
    }
}
```

#### **Database Replication**:
Use PostgreSQL replication (master-slave setup) for load balancing and high availability:

```ini
db_host = master.db.server
db_replica_host = replica.db.server  # For read queries.
```

---

### 4. **Monitoring and Metrics**

#### **Prometheus and Grafana**:
Set up Prometheus to export Odoo metrics and Grafana for visualization:

```ini
prometheus_port = 9090  # Example Prometheus exporter port.
```

#### **Log Rotation**:
Configure log rotation to prevent logs from growing too large:

```bash
/var/log/odoo/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    compress
    delaycompress
    create 640 odoo odoo
}
```

---

### 5. **Docker and Kubernetes Setup**

#### **Docker Compose**:
Use Docker Compose for Odoo and PostgreSQL container management:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: odoo:14
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "8069:8069"
  db:
    image: postgres:12
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=odoo
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=odoo
```

#### **Kubernetes**:
For more advanced scalability, deploy Odoo in Kubernetes with container orchestration for automatic scaling and traffic distribution.

---

### 6. **Development with Vagrant**

For reproducible local development environments, use Vagrant to set up and provision Odoo:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/focal64"
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y postgresql python3-pip
    pip3 install odoo
  SHELL
end
```
